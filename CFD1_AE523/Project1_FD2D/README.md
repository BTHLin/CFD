Understand finite difference method and how to use it in CFD cases. In this project, we consider a non-viscous, imcopressible, and steady fluid flows over a hanger (a half cylinder).  
  
Three steps were being followed to solve the problem, 1) estabilish computational grids, 2) solve governing equations with numerical methods, 
3) post-processing with stream function (and calculating lift and pressure coefficents.)  
  
Detail explanation of each step can be found in the project report.
